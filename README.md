# Demonstration of a customer Segmentation for an E-Commerce Site

## Project Overview
This project focuses on segmenting customers of a Brazilian e-commerce company using unsupervised learning techniques. The goal is to understand different types of users based on their behavior and personal data to target marketing campaigns effectively.

## Problem Statement
The primary objectives are:
- To understand the various types of users through their behavior and personal data.
- To address targeted marketing campaigns.

## Data Description
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes anonymized customer data with order histories, purchased products, satisfaction comments, and customer locations. The data spans from October 2016 to August 2018.

### Data Features
1. **Order Features**: Dates, amounts, payment types, deliveries, satisfaction scores, etc.
2. **Customer Features**: Locations.
3. **Product Features**: Vendor details, types, prices, etc.

The dataset was unified into a comprehensive table containing all orders and customer data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The exploratory analysis involved:
- Examining order distributions, with a majority of orders delivered and amounts clustered between 100 and 200 BRL.
- Analyzing payment methods, where 74% of payments were made by credit card.
- Identifying top-selling and least-selling products.
- Investigating customer behaviors, revealing that only 3% of customers placed more than one order.
- Visualizing customer distribution across cities, with SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro having the highest concentrations.

## Feature Engineering
Key steps in feature engineering included:
- Creating new features like Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values.
- Removing outliers and applying transformations to improve feature distributions.
- Generating RFM scores for customer segmentation.

## Modeling Approach
Several unsupervised learning algorithms were evaluated, with MiniBatchKMeans selected for its efficiency in handling large datasets. The modeling approach included:
- Using MiniBatchKMeans for clustering.
- Evaluating cluster stability over time to inform the maintenance contract.

### Clustering Results
The RFM analysis produced three clusters:
1. **Bronze**: New clients with low Recency and Monetary values, providing opportunities to convert them into loyal customers through targeted marketing.
2. **Silver**: Loyal customer base with moderate Recency and Monetary values, where marketing should focus on loyalty programs.
3. **Gold**: High-value, less frequent buyers, where marketing should target product recommendations to maximize spending.

## Conclusion
The segmentation model provides a robust framework for understanding customer behaviors and tailoring marketing strategies to different customer segments. The stability analysis suggests that periodic re-training of the model is necessary, particularly during high-order periods like year-end holidays.
